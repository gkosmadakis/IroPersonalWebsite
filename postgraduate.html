<p class="p1"> 1.<u>Immunohistochemistry (IHC):</u> To test the presence of dystrophin protein in sections of human musclle tissue. IHC uses antibodies 
to direct a staiming process to particular antigens. In this experiment used anti-dystrophin antibody on normal human muscle tissue 
and specific antibody will bind to dystophin If it is present in the tissue.<br><br>
2.<u>PCR-RFLP assay design and validation:</u>
To design and a test a PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism assay that could be used to detect the presence of a polymorphism
in individuals.<br><br>
3.<u>Mutation identification by sequencing(BRCA2):</u>
To use DNA sequencing output to characterise mutations in the BRCA2 gene and to generate a report.<br><br>
4.<u>DNA Extraction and sexing by PCR:</u>
The purpose of this experiment was to extract DNA from both whole human blood and blood spots on filter paper and to use PCR to determine 
the sex of the individuals from whom the blood was taken.For PCR amplification two primers are used each of which annealed to only one site
in the entire human genome, so the primer pair will amplify a single fragment of the genome.
In this 'sexing' PCR for a sample of male DNA expect to generate two different PCR products and for female should generate only 
X chromosome PCR product.<br><br>
5.<u>Dissertation project:</u>
The puprose of the project was to identify different transcription factors that are involved in signalling pathways and are correlate with
epithelial to mesenchymal transition in development of cancer. </p>
